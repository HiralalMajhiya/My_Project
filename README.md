Unsupervised Machine Learning Project:

On this project I am going to build a model which can predict Heart Disease with atleast 95% accuracy. This model looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries such as scikit_learn,Numpy, pandas ,matplotlib  in order to build this model capable of predicting wether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attribute.  
I am going to follow a standard Data Science approach To complete this project.
A) Data collection
B) Data Modelling
C) Deployment(Though i am not going to deploy it in real world)

B) Data Modelling consist of the following parts.....
1. problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation
